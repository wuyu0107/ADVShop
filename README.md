### Reflection 1
<details> 
    <summary>Write clean code principles and secure coding practices that have been applied to your code.  If you find any mistake in your source code, please explain how to improve your code.</summary>
    
    Coding standards I've learned and applied to this exercise are readability and maintainability. 
    I tried to keep each function do only one thing and make sure they work properly as intended. The code follows the formatting such as indentation consistent and make each lines of code short and clear so that they only do one job.
    To write cleaner code, the names of the functions and variables are clear, such as function findProductbyID, you can infer that this function is used to find a Product by its product ID just by its name.
